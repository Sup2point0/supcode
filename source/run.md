# Interpreters

WIP.


## Deravile
*The standard Supcode interpreter.*

Requires everything to be perfect; there can be no errors whatsoever.


## Tenqovile
*For when an operation failure is acceptable, but your program cannot stop running.*

Silently ignores errors during execution.


## Xendovile
*Operates using defaults.*


## Runvolt
*A lightweight interpreter focused on speed and performance.*


## Syvolt
*An all-new intelligent interpreter that interprets the purpose of your code, and is able to make corrections or ignore errors accordingly.*
