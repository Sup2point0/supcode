# Interpreters

WIP.


## Deravile

The standard Supcode interpreter. Requires everything to be perfect; there can be no errors whatsoever.


## Tenqovile

Silently ignores errors during execution. For when an operation failure is acceptable, but your program cannot stop running.


## Xendovile

Operates using defaults.


## Runvolt

A lightweight interpreter focused on speed and performance.


## Syvolt

An all-new intelligent interpreter that interprets the purpose of your code, and is able to make corrections or ignore errors accordingly.
